# Pogo Ride Leaderboard
The pogo ride Flash game's [leaderboard from Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/story/boarddisplay) recreated in Godot (v3.5.1)

Play the game [here](https://linkh.at/pogo)!

# Exporting to HTML5
Under the export options, load the custom HTML shell from the "[export](https://github.com/Sharkalien/Godot-Imp-Pogo-Ride-Minigame/tree/main/export)" folder. The preloader.gif won't be included in the export, so be sure to copy the file to the folder you export to.

Under the Resources tab, export "*.env" files for the SilentWolf API key if you wish to set up your own leaderboard (more info on that [here](https://escada-games.itch.io/jump3match/devlog/242610/making-a-simple-online-leaderboard-in-godot-with-silentwolf)).
